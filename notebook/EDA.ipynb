    "**Description:**\n",
    "This dataset explores the factors influencing life expectancy across various countries and years, aiming to uncover patterns and disparities in health outcomes based on geographic locations. By examining key features such as adult mortality, alcohol consumption, healthcare expenditures, and socioeconomic indicators, this dataset provides insights into the complex interplay of factors shaping life expectancy worldwide.\n",
